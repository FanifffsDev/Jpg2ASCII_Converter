# Jpg2Ascii_Converter
This program converts images into ASCII art using a simple algorithm. The output is an ASCII text representation of the image.

### Usage
1. Run `Jpg2Ascii.exe`.
2. Paste the path to the `image` into the console (_when a path contains spaces, you need to enclose the path in quotes_).
3. Wait a few seconds (_depends on the image size and quality set in the code_).

The output .txt file will be saved in the same directory as `Jpg2Ascii.exe` with the same name as `image` name.

4. Enjoy the result.
